Requires [Figura](https://figuramc.org/)

This is Fantasia Ruby, an avatar project based on my OC. I was working on this for a bit but lost focus a few months ago. I am not working on her atm and don't intend on returning anytime soon but who knows ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

**Ruby** is a tricky little feline treasure hunter who's ready for adventure! She is not complete, but there's still a lot to her:
- Custom walk/run/swim/attack/flight animations
- Custom jump and crouch poses
- Custom sword model (toggleable in the action wheel)
- Strip down to her skivvies for underwater treasure hunting (toggleable in the action wheel)
- Cloud compatible!

## 3rd party scripts used:

- [Squishy API](https://github.com/MrSirSquishy/SquishyAPI)
- [GSAnimBlend](https://github.com/GrandpaScout/GSAnimBlend)
- [EZAnims](https://github.com/JimmyHelp/JimmyAnims)

## What is Figura?

[Figura](https://figuramc.org/) is a minecraft mod that allows you to use [Blockbench](https://www.blockbench.net/) avatars as your in-game player character. These avatars can be more complex than typical custom player skins and can also have custom animations and actions to help breathe life into your Minecraft experience. Figura is a *client-side* mod so you can use it even if your minecraft server doesn't include it, and anyone else with Figura installed will be able to see your new appearance in-game as well! **(So long as you've uploaded your avatar to the cloud in the Figura menu)*

You can download Figura over at [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/figura) and [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/figura)

If you want to figure out how all of this works, or try your hand at making your own avatar, I recommend checking out [this tutorial series by ChloeSpacedOut](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNz7v2g2SFA8lOQUDS4z4-gIDLi_dWAhl) and visiting the [official Figura discord](https://discord.com/invite/figuramc) for help, ideas and inspiration.
