Requires [Figura](https://figuramc.org/)

**Ruby** is a tricky little feline treasure hunter who's ready for adventure!
- Loaded with quality hand-made animations and dynamic effects to bring her to life
- Custom sword and shield props (both toggleable in the action wheel)
- Custom Elytra glider for parachute riding
- Strip down to her skivvies for underwater treasure hunting (toggleable in the action wheel)
- Better Combat Mod compatibility
- Compatible with Figura's default permissions and (just) small enough to fit on the cloud!

Ruby pairs well with the [Bare Bones](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/bare-bones) texture pack and the [Fresh Animations](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/fresh-animations) resource pack!

## What is Figura?

[Figura](https://figuramc.org/) is a minecraft mod that allows you to use [Blockbench](https://github.com/JannisX11/blockbench/releases/tag/v4.12.6) avatars as your in-game player character. These avatars can be more complex than typical custom player skins and can also have custom animations, actions and powerful scripts to help breathe life into your Minecraft experience. Figura is a *client-side* mod so you can use it even if your minecraft server doesn't include it, and anyone else with Figura installed will be able to see your new appearance in-game as well! **(So long as you've uploaded your avatar to the cloud in the Figura menu)*

You can download Figura over at [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/figura) and [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/figura)

If you want to figure out how all of this works, or try your hand at making your own avatar, I recommend checking out [this tutorial series by ChloeSpacedOut](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNz7v2g2SFA8lOQUDS4z4-gIDLi_dWAhl) and visiting the [official Figura discord](https://discord.com/invite/figuramc) for help, ideas and inspiration.
