Requires [FiguraMC](https://figuramc.org/)

This is Fantasia Ruby, an avatar project based on my OC. I was working on this for a bit but lost focus a few months ago. I am not working on her atm and don't intend on returning anytime soon but who knows ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

**Ruby** is a tricky little feline treasure hunter who's ready for adventure! She is not complete, but there's still a lot to her:
- Custom walk/run/swim/attack/flight animations
- Custom jump and crouch poses
- Custom sword model (toggleable in the action wheel)
- Strip down to her skivvies for underwater treasure hunting (toggleable in the action wheel)
- Cloud compatible!

You are free to customize Ruby or use her as a base for your own characters.
